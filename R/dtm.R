#' @title dtm
#' @param X an n by d matrix of coordinates of points used to construct the uniform
#'   empirical measure for the distance to measure, where n is the number of points
#'   and d is the dimension.
#'
#' @param Grid an m by d matrix of coordinates of points where the distance to measure
#'   is computed, where m is the number of points in Grid and d is the dimension.
#'
#' @param m0 a numeric variable for the smoothing parameter of the distance to measure.
#'   Roughly, m0 is the the percentage of points of X that are considered when the distance
#'   to measure is computed for each point of Grid. The value of m0 should be in (0,1).
#'
#' @param r a numeric variable for the tuning parameter of the distance to measure.
#'   The value of r should be in [1,âˆž), and the default value is 2.
#'
#' @param weight either a number, or a vector of length n. If it is a number, then same
#'   weight is applied to each points of X. If it is a vector, weight represents weights of
#'   each points of X. The default value is 1.
#'
#' @return a vector of length m (the number of points stored in Grid)
#'   containing the value of the distance to measure function evaluated at each point of Grid.
