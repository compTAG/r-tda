NOTES:
- a way to cite Dmitriy is to list him as a contributor in the DESCRIPTION file. 
(see http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file)
It will look like:
Author: B.T. Fasy, J. Kim, F. Lecci, with contributions from D. Morozov.
I am note sure this is the best solution. I would prefer to simply add a note in the description that says that we use Dionysus.
