NOTES:
- a way to cite Dmitriy is to list him as a contributor in the DESCRIPTION file. 
(see http://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#The-DESCRIPTION-file)
It will look like:
Author: B.T. Fasy, J. Kim, F. Lecci, with contributions from D. Morozov.
I am note sure this is the best solution. I would prefer to simply add a note in the description that says that we use Dionysus.


TODO
- (Fabri) unify gridDiag and gridDiagBarycenter. Also modify all functions that depend on gridDiag.

- (Brit/Dave) Interaction between R and C++: output of diagrams
- (Brit) compute diagrams for a function defined over a grid (no conf. intervals)
