TODO

- (Jisu) extend gridDiag.R to any dimension
- (Jisu) include sphereUnif.R , but leave circleUnif as is.
- (Jisu) give option to use phat (no pressure on this. it's not essential)

- (Fabri) There was a problem at line 62 in gridDiag.R. It should be fixed, but check.
- (Fabri) in bottleneck and wasserstein add control that diagrams are not empty
- (Fabri) add printStatus to kde, kdeDist, etc
- (Fabri) check the best way to list the contributors (dionysus, phat..)

- (Brit/Dave) Interaction between R and C++: output of diagrams
- (Brit) compute diagrams for a function defined over a grid (no conf. intervals)

- (all) study Rcpp
- (all) think about the implementation of filtration proposed in section 3.2 of bobrowski
- (all) try Gudhi again
