TODO
- (all) study .Call() and Rcpp
- (all) think about the implementation of filtration proposed in section 3.2 of bobrowski
- (all) add more statistcal summaries, eg: distribution of Betti numbers, of birth times, of death times, of persistence values
- adding born time to the points, where points are not born in the same time (or implementing power distance)
- implementing intensity plots / persistence images
- getting simplicial complex as input, boundary matrix and representative cycle as output
- Jeff's paper: power distance construction for kernel density
- implement vine / vineyard
- (Jessi's request) getting KK as vector
- separating C++ files
- using Doxygen in code
- how to do todo-list
- taking *.obj file as an input
- allow cubical complex
