### TDA: version 1.4.1
- remove alphaDiag function temporarily for installation error in Windows

### TDA: version 1.4
- fixed bugs
- Rcpp is used in gridDiag, bottleneck & wasserstein distance, kde, kernel distance, dtm, ripsDiag, and alphaDiag

- kde, kernel distance, and dtm have weighted version
- bootstrapBand, bootstrapDiagram, and maxPersistence can do weighted bootstrap
- parallel option is possible in bootstrapDiagram
- alphaDiag computes persistence Diagram of alpha shape in 3d
- PHAT is available for ripsDiag
- ripsDiag also returns location of representative cycles

### TDA: version 1.3
- fixed bugs (memory leak in GUDHI, "1.#INF" code in Windows)
- gridDiag now returns also location of representative cycles
- clusterTree now returns r-Tree, lambda-Tree, alpha-Tree and kappa-Tree

### TDA: version 1.2

- gridDiag extended to arbitrary dimension
- PHAT can be used in gridDiag
- GUDHI can be used in ripsDiag (requires R>=3.1.0)

### TDA: version 1.1
- fixed bug in diag.cpp, line 421 [ fcnvalues.at(curidx) = x ]
